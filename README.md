# pPlotting
Plotting library for MATLAB 2014b or above

These tools mean to implement some features that I miss in MATLAB,

Currently there are two tools implemented:
Colormaps 	- A set of alternative colormaps for MATLAB
plottypes 	- Plotting tools which are ill-supported in MATLAB

You can see the CONCEPTS filefor a full description.
